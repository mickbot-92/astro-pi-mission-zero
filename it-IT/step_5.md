## Invia il tuo progetto

You can now enter the [Astro Pi Mission Zero](https://astro-pi.org/mission-zero){:target="_blank"} challenge, using the code you have written.

There are a few rules your code needs to follow so that you can submit it to be run on the International Space Station. If your code follows them, the rules at the bottom of the **Sense HAT emulator** will light up in green when you run the program.

**Tip:** Test your code with a few different colour settings (using the picker) to make sure it always runs correctly.

Please make sure that your entry follows the [official guidelines](https://astro-pi.org/mission-zero/guidelines){:target="_blank"} for Mission Zero. If it does not follow the guidelines, your program will not be able to run on the International Space Station.

Please do not include any of the following in your team name or code:

+ Tutto ciò che potrebbe essere interpretato come di natura illegale, politica o sensibile
+ Bandiere, in quanto possono essere considerate politicamente sensibili
+ Tutto ciò che fa riferimento a spiacevolezza o danno a un'altra persona
+ Dati personali come numeri di telefono, account social e indirizzi e-mail
+ Immagini oscene
+ Caratteri speciali o emoji
+ Linguaggio scurrile o parolacce
