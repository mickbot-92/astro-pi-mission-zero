## Esittely

Complete this project to enter [Astro Pi Mission Zero](https://astro-pi.org/mission-zero){:target="_blank"} and have your code run in space. Use the the colour luminosity sensor on the new Mark II Astro Pi computer’s Sense HAT and display a matching image on the LED matrix to brighten up the daily routine of the astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS).

**If your project meets the [eligibility criteria](https://astro-pi.org/mission-zero/eligibility){:target="_blank"}**, your completed program will be run on the International Space Station! You will also receive a special certificate that shows exactly where the ISS was when your program ran.

You will learn about the Astro Pi unit and how to control it, including how to:
+ Viestien ja värien näyttäminen
+ Kuvien tekeminen
+ Sense the colour of light on board the ISS

### What you will need

You will use the online Sense HAT emulator to create your program, so no extra hardware is needed — everything is done in a web browser.

### What you will make

Here is an example of the kind of program you could make. <mark>change image here</mark>

title: Notes for educators
---

Mission Zero is suitable for beginners to programming and/or primary school-aged children and can be completed in a single 60-minute session on any computer with internet access. No special hardware or prior coding skills are needed. Everything can be done in a web browser.

Organise your young creators into teams of one to four, and let us guide them through writing a short Python program to sense the colour on board the ISS and create an image that uses that colour.
