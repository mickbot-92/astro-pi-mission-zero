## Izmerite vlažnost

<mark>check this with digital - is it the same?</mark> There are a few rules your code needs to follow so that you can submit it to be run on the International Space Station. If your code follows them, the rules at the bottom of the [Sense HAT emulator](https://trinket.io/mission-zero) will light up in green when you run the program. <mark>update trinket link to emulator</mark>

![The Mission Zero Trinket pages showing the submission button and the criteria checks on the left. The top two ("read humidity" and "use the LEDs") are in orange text, the bottom one ("runs without any errors") is green.](images/validation.png)

1. Take a colour sensor reading.
2. Light up the LEDs.
3. Ensure your code runs all the way to the end without any errors occurring. You should not include any `while True` loops in your code as this will keep your code running and prevent it from finishing.
4. Test your code with a few different colour settings (using the picker) to make sure it will always run correctly.

1. Make sure your program runs for no longer than 30 seconds, as this is how long your code will run for on the ISS
2. Avoid using any methods needing input
3. Only import from the `sense_hat`, `time`, and `random` modules
