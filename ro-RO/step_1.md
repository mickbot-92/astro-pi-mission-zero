## Introducere

Îmbunătățește rutina zilnică a astronauților de pe Stația Spațială Internațională, arătându-le un mesaj și umiditatea aerului ambiant la bord folosind Sense HAT-ul computerului Astro Pi.

You will use the online Sense HAT emulator to create your program, so no extra hardware is needed — everything is done in a web browser.

*If it meets the eligibility criteria*, your completed program will be run in space on the International Space Station (ISS)! You will also receive a special certificate that shows exactly where the ISS was when your program ran.

### Ce vei face

Here is an example of the kind of program you could make. <mark>change image here</mark>

Mission Zero is suitable for beginners to programming and/or primary school-aged children and can be completed in a single 60-minute session on any computer with internet access. No special hardware or prior coding skills are needed. Everything can be done in a web browser.

Organise your students into teams of one to four, and let us guide them through writing a short Python program to sense the colour on board and create an image that uses that colour.
