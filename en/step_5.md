## Submit your entry

<mark>check this with digital - is it the same?</mark>
There are a few rules your code needs to follow so that you can submit it to be run on the International Space Station. If your code follows them, the rules at the bottom of the [Sense HAT emulator](https://trinket.io/mission-zero) will light up in green when you run the program. <mark>update trinket link to emulator</mark>

![The Mission Zero Trinket pages showing the submission button and the criteria checks on the left. The top two ("read humidity" and "use the LEDs") are in orange text, the bottom one ("runs without any errors") is green.](images/validation.png)

Your code should:

1. Take a colour sensor reading.
2. Light up the LEDs.
3. Run all the way to the end without any errors occurring. 

**Tip:** Test your code with a few different colour settings (using the picker) to make sure it always runs correctly. 

Also make sure you have met the following criteria:

1. Make sure your program runs for no longer than 30 seconds, as this is how long your code will run for on the ISS. You should not include any `while True` loops in your code as this will keep your code running and prevent it from finishing.
2. Avoid using any methods needing input.
3. Only import from the `sense_hat`, `time`, and `random` modules.

Please make sure that your entry follows the [official guidelines](https://astro-pi.org/mission-zero/guidelines){:target="_blank"} for Mission Zero. If it does not follow the guidelines, your program will not be able to run on the International Space Station. 

Please do not include any of the following in your team name or code:  

+ Anything that could be interpreted as being of an illegal, a political, or a sensitive nature
+ Flags, as they can be considered politically sensitive
+ Anything that references unpleasantness or harm to another person
+ Personal data such as telephone numbers, social media handles, and email addresses
+ Obscene images
+ Special characters or emojis
+ Bad language or swearing
