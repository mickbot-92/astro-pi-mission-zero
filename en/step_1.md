## Introduction

Brighten up the daily routine of the astronauts on the International Space Station by sensing the colour of light on board and showing them an image using that colour on the new Mark II Astro Pi computer's Sense HAT.

You will use the online Sense HAT emulator to create your program, so no extra hardware is needed â€” everything is done in a web browser.

*If it meets the eligibility criteria* your completed program will be run in space on the International Space Station (ISS)! You will also receive a special certificate that shows exactly where the ISS was when your program ran.

### What you will make

Here is an example of the kind of program you could make. <mark>change image here</mark>

Mission Zero is suitable for beginners to programming and/or primary school aged children and can be completed in a single 60-minute session and on any computer with internet access. No special hardware or prior coding skills are needed. Everything can be done in a web browser. 

Organise your students into teams of one to four, and let us guide them through writing a short Python program to sense the colour on board and create an image that uses that colour.

 We have created [a printable two-page handout](http://rpf.io/mz-printout){:target="_blank"} that covers the key points of Mission Zero and that students and young people can use together with this online project.
