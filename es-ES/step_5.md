## Submit your entry

There are a few rules your code needs to follow so that you can submit it to be run on the International Space Station. If your code follows them, the rules at the bottom of the **Sense HAT emulator** will light up in green when you run the program.

**Nota:** Es una buena idea dar a las variables de color nombres de una sola letra, puesto que te ahorrará tiempo en el siguiente paso, en donde vas a escribirlas muchas veces.

Please make sure that your entry follows the [official guidelines](https://astro-pi.org/mission-zero/guidelines){:target="_blank"} for Mission Zero. If it does not follow the guidelines, your program will not be able to run on the International Space Station.

Please do not include any of the following in your team name or code:

+ Anything that could be interpreted as being of an illegal, a political, or a sensitive nature
+ Flags, as they can be considered politically sensitive
+ Anything that references unpleasantness or harm to another person
+ Personal data such as telephone numbers, social media handles, and email addresses
+ Obscene images
+ Special characters or emojis
+ Bad language or swearing
